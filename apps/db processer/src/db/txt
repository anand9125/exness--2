What is OHLC?

Open → First price in the interval.

High → Maximum price.

Low → Minimum price.

Close → Last price.

TimescaleDB can calculate OHLC easily using:

FIRST(column, time) → first value in the bucket.

LAST(column, time) → last value in the bucket.

MAX(column) → highest value.

MIN(column) → lowest value.

How?

We use continuous aggregates (materialized views) with time_bucket function.
