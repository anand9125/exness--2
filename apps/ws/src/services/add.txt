A callback is just a function that you pass into another function.
Later, that function gets called automatically when something happens.

function greet(callback: (name: string) => void) {
  const user = "Anand";
  callback(user); // instead of printing, we give "Anand" to whoever calls greet
}
Here callback is a function we will pass in later.

callback(user) means:
👉 “Hey, I’ve got the user’s name. You decide what to do with it.”

When we call greet, we pass a function:
greet((name) => {
  console.log("Hello " + name);
});
(name) => { console.log("Hello " + name); } is our callback.

Inside greet, it runs callback("Anand").

That becomes: console.log("Hello Anand").
 Output: Hello Anand.




 const p = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    resolve("Done!");
  }, 2000);
});

p.then(result => console.log(result)); // prints "Done!" after 2s

new Promise(...) takes a function with two arguments: resolve (success) and reject (failure).
After 2 seconds, we call resolve("Done!")
Whoever was waiting on the promise will now get "Done!".






Bucket part => 🔎 Step by step with example

Say you have:

tsMs = 16:03:25 (in ms)

minutes = 5

Convert 5 minutes → ms:

5 * 60_000 = 300000 ms


Divide the timestamp by bucket size:

tsMs / 300000 ≈ 53.34


Math.floor(53.34) = 53
(floor pushes it down to the full bucket start)

Multiply back by 300000:

53 * 300000 = 15:55:00


✅ So any tick at 16:03:25 gets assigned to the 15:55–16:00 candle.

📊 Why it matters

This is how your system decides which candle a tick belongs to.
Without this “bucketing,” ticks would just be floating around.

It’s the foundation of candle building.




now clear everything=> 

Take a timestamp in milliseconds (tsMs) → e.g., 16:03:25.

Take a time interval in minutes (minutes) → e.g., 5.

Calculate:

minutes * 60_000 = bucket size in ms (for 5 min → 300000).

tsMs / bucketSize → figure out how many full buckets have passed.

Math.floor(...) → round down to the nearest full bucket.

Multiply back by bucket size → gives you the bucket start time.

👉 So basically: “Snap this timestamp back to the start of its time block.”

Why we need it

We need it because candlesticks (OHLCV charts) work in fixed time windows.

Example:

A 5-minute candle means all ticks that happen between 16:00 and 16:04:59 belong to the 16:00 candle.

Without bucketing, ticks at 16:01, 16:02, 16:03 would look like they belong to different times → chaos ❌.

With bucketing, we group them neatly into one candle (16:00–16:04:59) ✅
In super simple words

This function is like saying:

“Whatever time you give me, I’ll tell you which candle (time box) it belongs to.”.

We are building time buckets of a fixed size (for example, 1 min, 3 min, 5 min, etc.) so that we can later use them to build candles.

Whenever a new tick (with a timestamp) arrives:

This function checks the tick’s timestamp.

It calculates which bucket (time interval) that tick should belong to.

Example:

If bucket size = 5 minutes

Tick arrives at 16:03:25

Function will say → this tick belongs to the 16:00–16:05 bucket.
